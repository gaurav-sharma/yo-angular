yo-angular
==========

Simple CRUD AngularJS app. Multiple AngularJS features are demonstrated:

1. Directive: When adding a person, the validations are performed by a custom directive
2. JSON data is retrieved and processed via $resource
3. Entire application is managed via Yeoman. The project is generated and managed via the 
angular generator for Yeoman(https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) 

The backend is a Spring application hosted on Heroku. It's on the free tier and usually takes a few seconds to wake up. The repo for this is at https://github.com/gaurav-sharma/simple-spring-rest


You can see the app in action at http://www.gauravsharma.io/yo-angular/dist/
